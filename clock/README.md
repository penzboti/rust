## how does it work
2d array of the letters
we then based on the time create another 2d array of "bools"
then we write the letters, and change the colors according to the "bool" array
in main we have the time loop
command line arguments for different timezones
'UTC' or manual input like '-6' or '+2'
-t, -time where you can input the starting time, and it will tick like it normally would
