# info
Controll two points on the screen
One of which, is a start of the laser pointer.
And the other one, is a transparent target.

Logically, the laser pointer points to the target, but the actual laser goes trough, and touches the border of the window.

# ideas
Move them with wasd, and arrow keys. Switch inputs with the space & tab key. Exit with enter & ctrl+c.
Make both inputs flicker. At different times ofc.
